This analysis is for Case Study 1 - Cyclistic, from the Google Data Analytics Certificate.  It’s originally based on the case study \"'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization\" written by Kevin Hartman (found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). We will be using the Divvy dataset for the case study. \n\n**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\n   Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago, USA. In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n    Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.  The have flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n    The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships and has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. \n    The purpose of this R script is to conduct simple analysis in the the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to help answering **the key question: “In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?”**\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2.
